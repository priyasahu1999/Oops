        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It helps in organizing code in a more modular and reusable way by grouping data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together.\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "  - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        " - An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) defined by its class.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        " - Abstraction\n",
        "    - Hiding implementation details and showing only the necessary functionality.\n",
        "    - Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        " - Encapsulation\n",
        "    - Hiding data by restricting direct access and allowing modification through controlled methods.\n",
        "     - Protects the integrity of data by preventing unauthorized access.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods, also known as \"magic methods\" or \"special methods,\" are built-in methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (__). They enable customization of class behavior, allowing objects to work seamlessly with Python’s built-in functions and operators.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " - Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (child class) inherits the properties and methods of another class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and helps in organizing code in a hierarchical manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is an OOP concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying data types, promoting flexibility and code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that restricts direct access to class attributes and methods to prevent accidental modification. It helps in data protection and abstraction by controlling how data is accessed and modified.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "  - A constructor in Python is a special method __init__() that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        " - In Python, class methods and static methods are used to define methods that are not tied to an instance but instead to the class itself.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        " - Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. In many programming languages (like Java and C++), method overloading allows defining multiple methods with different numbers or types of arguments.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        " - Method overriding is an OOP feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the child class must have the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the parent class.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        " - The @property decorator in Python is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods in a class while maintaining a clean and intuitive syntax. It allows us to control how class attributes are accessed and modified, promoting encapsulation.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It provides flexibility, scalability, and code reusability, making software more maintainable and easier to extend.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines methods that must be implemented by its child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, abstract classes are created using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module from abc.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides a structured and modular approach to software development. It improves code organization, reusability, scalability, and maintainability.\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), class variables and instance variables are used to store data, but they differ in scope, accessibility, and behavior.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple base classes.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "  - Both __str__ and __repr__ are dunder (double underscore) methods in Python that control how objects are represented as strings. The key difference lies in their purpose and usage.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " - The super() function in Python allows access to methods of a parent (or superclass) from a child (or subclass). It is commonly used in inheritance to avoid explicitly referring to the parent class.\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        " - The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is a special dunder (double underscore) method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is garbage collected).\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
        "  - Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods inside a class that do not operate on instances in the usual way. However, they have key differences in how they access class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        " - When a child class overrides a method from a parent class, this is an example of method overriding, a key aspect of polymorphism.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "  - Method chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, improving code readability and efficiency.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python ?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When an object has __call__ defined, calling the object executes the __call__ method."
